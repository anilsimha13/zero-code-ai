### 1. Introduction

#### 1a. What is AI?

_AI stands for Artificial Intelligence which is a Computer system that can learn from experience and make decisions!_

- AI Experience comes from Losts of Data, Learning from Data and Output/Decisions

##### 1a.a. What is LLM?

_LLM stands for Large Language Model is a specific type of AI that specializes in understanding and generating human lanugage_

#### 1b. What is ML?

_ML Stands for Machine Learning which is a process of teaching Computer from examples not instructions._

- ML learning way: Thousand of password combinations > Undestand which is strong or weak password > Tells how to generate complex strong password

##### 1b.a. Different types of ML?

- Supervised Learning

  _AI will learn from different labels of example_

- Unsupervised learning

  _AI will learn from different unlabeled of example_

- Reinforcement learning

  _AI will learn from different trial & errors by receiving rewards or penality for its action_

- Self-supervised learning

  _This is a clever approach where the system creates its own labels from the data_

- Transfer Learning

  _This involves taking a model trained on one task and adapting it to a related task._

- Semi-supervised learning
- Few-shot learning
- Zero-shot learning

#### 1c. Understanding AI models and Fine-tuning bascis

##### 1c.a. What is AI model?

_AI model is like a trained "Brain" that can make "Predictions" or generate content_

### 2. Working with Large Language Models locally with Ollama

#### 2a. Introduction and why Local Large Language Model to run in Local Machine?

- GPTForAll
- LMStudio
- OLLAMA

### 3. Prompt Engineering - How to write better Prompt

#### 3a. Introduction to Prompt Engineering

_Prompts are the instructions you give to AI to get what you want_

### Good Prompt Structure

- Role
- Task
- Context
- Format
- Constraints

### Types of Prompts

- Zero-shot prompt
- One-shot prompt
- Few-shot prompt
- Role based prompt
- Chain-of-thought prompt

### 4. Understanding and working with AI agents and MCP servers

#### 4a.a What are AI agents?

_AI Agent is like the hand and leg of LLMS which can do operations on your machine/server, which LLMS cannot_

#### 4b.a What is MCP?

_Is a standard designed to help AI assistants work more effectively by connecting them to the systems and tools where relevant data resides_
